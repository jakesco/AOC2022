## Puzzle Input Tip

If you have your Advent of Code session token saved to a file like `.token`, you can download your test input with curl:
```
$ curl "https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1/input" \
       --header "Cookie: $(cat .token)"
```
You can find your session token by looking at the `Cookie` header in the network tab
in your browser tools when navigating to https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1/input.
Save the value of this `Cookie` header in `.token`. e.g.
```
session=XXX
```
